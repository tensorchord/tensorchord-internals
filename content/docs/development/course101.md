# Course 101

We assume that you already have the basic computer science knowledge. If not, you can check the [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).

However, the real software engineering is more than that. You may need to ssh to a remote server, edit some files with `vi`, search error messages with regex, collaborate with others on the same pull request, etc.

Luckily, there is an open source course: [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). We highly recommend you to take this course, even if you're already an experienced engineer.
